# HyperskillProject-BudgetManager
Hyperskill (JetBrains Academy) project. Budget manager.

Console application where you can save your balance, add purchases 
and prices for them, categorizing them. When adding a purchase, 
the application will calculate the balance. You can build a report 
on waste for all purchases, for each of the categories or 
for purchases from a specific category. You can also save all the 
information you have recorded in a separate file, and then load from it.
